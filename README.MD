# What is this? #

This repository is created to store the source files of the website [https://nim-pro.github.io](https://nim-pro.github.io "https://nim-pro.github.io").

The fact is that GitHub does not allow it to be stored on dynamic websites. So I use [wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/ "wintersmith") to generate it.
